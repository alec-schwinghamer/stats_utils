    "This example will demonstrate how to use the randomization inference tools to analyze the results of a two variant A/B test, where the primary metric is continuous (e.g. dollars spent).  We'll first look at an example where the distributions of the continuous metric in both the control and treatment group are nicely behaved.  Here, conventional techniques like a t-test are sufficient.  We'll compare the application of the t-test to the randomization inference results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a second example, we'll look at data from an experiment where the outcome metric is heavily skewed by zeros (zero inflated).  In this case, the usual t-test approach is not applicable.  Instead, we'll use the randomization inference tools to look at the experiment results without needing to make any parametric assumptions about our data.  "
